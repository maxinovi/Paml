Paml stands for Pallada Modeling Language, an object-modeling language as a part of <a href="http://pallada-project.com">Pallada project</a>. The Pallada project is an attempt to research and develop a modeling language and corresponding tools to improve object-oriented approach based on concepts of OOP, DDD and AOP.

Paml concepts are originally described <a href="http://pallada-project.com/2015/11/08/paml-concepts">here</a>, but the concepts have been updated since the project started and develop.

The key concepts of Paml are:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Strict and simple object modeling and decomposition.</b>
    Objects collaborate each other via messages. There are no properties, fields, or something else from implementation world.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Simplicity via high-level abstractions.</b>
    Simple means abstractions only from domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Practical idioms, patterns and approaches are language features.</b>
    Data model is an abstraction via associations. CRQS via messages for writing, data for reading. 
    Unit tests are attributes of appropriate Paml code elements. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Separation of Paml domain models and technological environment.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Source code is produced by metaprogramming.</b>
    Source code is not manually written, but is produced and generated from Paml models. 
    Paml provides the capability for productions and generations for output code. 
    Anyway, traditional programming takes in play here to implement resources like memory and algorithms. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>IDE support is mandatory.</b>
    Paml code is not a plain text, but a styled text. Style makes sense for element semantic. 
    Paml elements are composed and applied to other ones (meta features). 
  </li>
</ul>
